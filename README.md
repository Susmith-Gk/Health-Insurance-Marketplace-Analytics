# 🏥 Health Insurance Marketplace Analytics – Data Product Dashboard

This project analyzes publicly available data from the U.S. Health Insurance Marketplace to explore pricing trends, insurer participation, and plan coverage across states and metal tiers. Built as an **end-to-end data product**, it simulates a real-world analytics solution from raw data ingestion to dashboard delivery.

## 📊 Project Objective

To build a reliable, interactive analytics dashboard that allows users to:
- Compare average premiums across **metal tiers** and **states**
- Identify patterns in **insurer participation** and **coverage density**
- Explore plan attributes and spot outliers in **premium pricing**
- Demonstrate data product delivery using **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **validation workflows**

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – for data modeling, dashboarding, and user interaction
- **SQL (SQLite)** – for querying structured health insurance plan data
- **Python (optional scripts)** – for data validation and wrangling
- **Excel** – for quick exploration and cross-checking
- **Kaggle Dataset**: [Health Insurance Marketplace Public Use Files](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hhs/health-insurance-marketplace)
